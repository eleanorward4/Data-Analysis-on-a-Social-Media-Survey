# Data-Analysis-on-a-Social-Media-Survey

Nov 2023 - Dec 2023  

This project involved using R Studio to summarise and analyse data from a social media survey. I produced numerical summaries and data visualisations through R code alongside description to create an informative poster. 
This project scored 94% and contributed to my grade in the module "Probability, Statistics and Data".
